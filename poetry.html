    <main><h2>For My People</h2></main>
        <p>By Margaret Walker</p>

        <p>For my people everywhere singing their slave songs
            repeatedly: their dirges and their ditties and their blues
            and jubilees, praying their prayers nightly to an
            unknown god, bending their knees humbly to an
            unseen power;</p>
       
            <p>For my people lending their strength to the years, to the
           gone years and the now years and the maybe years,
           washing ironing cooking scrubbing sewing mending
           hoeing plowing digging planting pruning patching
           dragging along never gaining never reaping never
           knowing and never understanding;</p>
       
           <p>For my playmates in the clay and dust and sand of Alabama
           backyards playing baptizing and preaching and doctor
           and jail and soldier and school and mama and cooking
           and playhouse and concert and store and hair and
           Miss Choomby and company;</p>
       
           <p>For the cramped bewildered years we went to school to learn
           to know the reasons why and the answers to and the
           people who and the places where and the days when, in
           memory of the bitter hours when we discovered we
           were black and poor and small and different and nobody
           cared and nobody wondered and nobody understood;</p>
       
           <p>For the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things to
           be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing and
           play and drink their wine and religion and success, to
           marry their playmates and bear children and then die
           of consumption and anemia and lynching;</p>
       
           <p>For my people thronging 47th Street
           and Lenox Avenue in New York and Rampart Street in New
           Orleans, lost disinherited dispossessed and happy
           people filling the cabarets and taverns and other
           people’s pockets and needing bread and shoes and milk and
           land and money and something—something all our own;</p>
       
           <p>For my people walking blindly spreading joy, losing time
            being lazy, sleeping when hungry, shouting when
            burdened, drinking when hopeless, tied, and shackled
            and tangled among ourselves by the unseen creatures
            who tower over us omnisciently and laugh;</p>
       
            <p>For my people blundering and groping and floundering in
            the dark of churches and schools and clubs
            and societies, associations and councils and committees and
            conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived and
            devoured by money-hungry glory-craving leeches,
            preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, by
            false prophet and holy believer;</p>
       
            <p>For my people standing staring trying to fashion a better way
           from confusion, from hypocrisy and misunderstanding,
           trying to fashion a world that will hold all the people,
           all the faces, all the adams and eves and their countless generations;</p>
       
           <p><i> Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a
           bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second
           generation full of courage issue forth; let a people
           loving freedom come to growth.</i> <!--These sentences embrace new beginnings, hope, and growth--> Let a beauty full of
           healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing
           in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial songs
           be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now
           rise and take control.</p>
